- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
    Encapsulation helps with organization, but figuring out what parts interact and how is hard.

    I had to look at a lot of stuff related to ArrayLists; I didn't know that they have to be imported first. Definitely use the Java documentation if you're not sure about what something does/how to do something. It's how I learned ArrayList has .contains() too.
    I realized when I was trying to test my code that I only initialized the ArrayList for Cars but didn't initialize or add any cars. Testing the methods made me realize I had to change printManifest() to a void function and just take it out of System.out.println() for it to work.
